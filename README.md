### How to play
Coordinate game where one participant has a coordinate that only they can see, and with just one word, they must give a clue to their teammates about which coordinate they have in their hands, using as clues the words associated with each row and column.

## Rules 
One player from the team sees the card with the coordinate. 
Their mission is to give their team only one word so they can guess which coordinate is being referred to by crossing the clue words on the board. 
When the team reaches a consensus, they must select their option. Then it will be the next team's turn.
When there are 5 coordinates left undiscovered, the game ends with the team that has scored the most points.
